            "Assemble the tortilla: Spread the butter mixture on one side of the tortilla, then flip and on the inner half of the tortilla, first spread most of the cheese, add half of the broccoli, season with salt and pepper, and then top with the remaining cheese. Fold the tortilla.",
            "Cook the tortilla: Transfer the tortilla to a pan on the stove and cover (to melt the cheese). Cook for about two minutes. Once the cheese melts and the bottom of the tortilla is golden, flip and cook the other side.",
            "Serve: Transfer the cooked tortilla to a cutting board, cut into pieces, and serve immediately. It pairs well with a bit of sour cream or Greek yogurt, and is also great with a bowl of salad or a plate of soup."
